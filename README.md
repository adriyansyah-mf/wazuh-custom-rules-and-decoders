# Wazuh Custom Decoders and Rules
This project contains custom decoders and rules for Wazuh, created by me.

### How to use
Simply put these files under /var/ossec/etc/rules and /var/ossec/etc/decoders.

### Disclaimer 
Feel free to use it, you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of GPLv2. 
Cybersecurity is hard, so let's work together.

### Updates
I will update rules and decoders if the projects I work on require them.
